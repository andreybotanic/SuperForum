            Tsukihime is a visual novel, released in December 2001 by
            TYPE-MOON. It tells the story of Tohno Shiki, who since a
            life-threatening accident in his youth is cursed with the
            ability to see "lines" on everything around him. Lines
            along which objects can easily be cut.

            A (Ryuusoul): That question has been kind of answered in part via other questions, but I'll
            answer it directly here. Tsukihime is the joint project between Revolve and mirror moon.
            It sounds like an important distinction, but only in terms of group history. As far as working
            goes, it never made much of a difference... Revolve started working on it in early 2004,
            according to TheXev. Progress didn't really kick off until early September, when I joined up.
            By strange coincidence, mirror moon, which had been working independently since July 2004,
            joined up with us at about the same time... We thought we were around perhaps 12% when that
            happened, but due to a silly error (silly chendo), we were actually in the low single digits
            of percentage translated. From then on out, things went very smoothly in terms of translation.
            We divided it up by scene blocks and went on from there. When TakaJun joined us in June 2005,
            we had around ten percent left to translate. Both of us worked furiously and finished the
            translation. At around this point, I felt the project was in good hands and I retired from
            translation... sort of. All through this time, we had a million proofers independently
            working on editing files, which resulted in a giant cluster... When beta testing started, it
            was recognized that a rewrite was needed, or at least the style be made similar. Shirakani
            took it upon himself to rewrite Tsukihime, but there were a few stylistic disagreements over
            his method. At around this time, in January 2006, I suddenly reappeared on the translation
            scene. I took over Shirakani's rewrite, which was taking a long time because he literally
            was rewriting everything, and things took off from there. I finished my massive proof
            and moved on to Melty Blood. Sadly, progress on the Beta testing did not resume until a few
            months later, but after it did, we got on the same page and hashed out what you see today.

            Okay, now to answer your question... It technically took about 2 3/4 years, but as far as real
            working goes, a little over two years due to a big pause in the beginning. Translation took
            only 10 months, and I expected it to be done before Christmas 2005... and it probably should
            have been. What was our main problem? It was a lack of an absolute central direction. I am sorry
            to say that some of this was my fault, as I up and left the project, but I honestly believed it
            was on the right page at the time. With a project as large as Tsukihime, which you must remember
            dwarfs The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy combined, any mistakes become greatly
            amplified. I am also sorry to say that I personally believe some of our problems came from
            a lack of initiative and motivation by some staff members. When I returned to the translation
            scene, I kept much of that in mind and was perhaps a little bullying in my approach to
            decision-making. Fortunately, I think some of the other staff members either respected me for
            my work on the translation or welcomed my "energy" coming back into the project. I would be
            amiss if I didn't credit Message for a lot of his administrative work on the beta testing.
            I became the "attack dog" and the "bad guy" during some parts to keep progress going,
            but he kept us grounded during this phase. All of that being said, I was still pleasantly
            surprised by the dedication of many members in this project. There were a lot of people who
            signed up and were not quite able to finish what they had allotted due to real life, but even
            their contributions are greatly appreciated. In the end, I was happy to work with so many
            wonderful people!

            The number one lesson to be taken from the project? Making decisions. A wise man once told me
            that managers don't exist to solve problems, but to make decisions. Once you make a
            decision, you have no problems. I was always reluctant to just barge in and make decisions on
            this project because I felt it wasn't my place... but when things didn't go anywhere, all it
            took was a decision. What I jokingly called my Executive Decisions would often provide the
            impetus
