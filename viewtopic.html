            Tsukihime is a visual novel, released in December 2001 by
            TYPE-MOON. It tells the story of Tohno Shiki, who since a
            life-threatening accident in his youth is cursed with the
            ability to see "lines" on everything around him. Lines
            along which objects can easily be cut.
            Having lived with foster parents for seven years, Shiki is
            recalled to the household of his family. He had lost all
            contact with his family over this entire period, making it
            difficult for him to get used to the new situation.
            As he gradually learns more about his past, the situation
            becomes more and more unfamiliar and dangerous.
